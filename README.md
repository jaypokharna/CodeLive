## Features üåü
- **Realtime Collaboration:** Multiple users can edit code in the same room simultaneously, with changes being reflected in real-time for all users.
- **Room Creation and Joining:** Users can create personal rooms with unique room IDs and passwords, as well as join existing rooms by providing the correct credentials.
- **Persistent Code Storage:** Code changes are stored in MongoDB in real-time, ensuring that no changes are lost even if the application is closed accidentally.
- **Dynamic Coding Phrases:** A fun coding-related phrase is displayed in the code editor each time the application is loaded, with a 1 in 1000 chance of getting the same phrase again.
- **Hidden Room Details:** Room details such as the room ID and password are hidden by default and can be revealed by hovering over a tooltip.
- **Input Data Provision:** Users can provide command-line arguments as input data to their Python code. Realtime/runtime input provision will be added soon.
- **Theme Switching:** Users will soon be able to switch between light mode and dark mode themes.
